# Mathematica support for the Faddeeva package

This Mathematica package provides all functions of the 
[Faddeeva Package](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Faddeeva_Package). It uses `LibraryLink` to build
wrapper definitions so that Faddeeva C-functions can directly be called from inside Mathematica.
